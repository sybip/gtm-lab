# GTM-LAB
An unofficial goTenna Mesh protocol playground

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the GTM Lab. This is a fun project to study and 
re-implement the goTenna Mesh protocols on inexpensive hardware based on the 
ESP32 MCU and RFM95W radio modules, using only unrestricted, publicly available 
information. All project code is open source under the [MIT license](/LICENSE).

The inspiration for the project was a message posted by user **dillon** 
on the goTenna community forum:
> put a goTenna assembly line in every home and letâ€™s see them fight this door-to-door

While the long-term goal of the project is a fully GTM interoperable open-source 
protocol stack running on open-source hardware, the short term goal is really just 
to have fun and share the lessons learned.

So, if protocol reverse-engineering and exploring the sub-GHz ISM band are 
your idea of fun too, grab a copy of the code and give it a spin!

## Development status
Executive summary: **can send and receive messages** to/from the goTenna 
mesh network.

### RX capability:
- preamble and syncword detection
- control channel scanning
- error correction
- control packet (SYNC/ACK) reception
- data packet reception and reassembly

### TX capability:
- assemble radio packets with header and error correction codes
- generate ACK, SYNC, DATA, TIME packets with correct formats
- packetize and send large payloads - up to 255 bytes
- control channel listen-before-talk

### Relay/mesh capability:
- tentative implementation, more work required

## Interop testing
The software is tested for interoperation with:
- itself
- goTenna Mesh, firmware 1.1.8

## Code quality
Could be indulgently described as *barely functional early-proof-of-concept*

## Supported hardware
- **Easy:** out of the box, the code contains pre-defined configurations for 
two widely available, **open-source hardware** boards, selectable via the 
`BOARD_TYPE` definition in the configuration file:
  - [LILYGO T-Beam 1.0](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-Beam) and newer
  - [Sparkfun WRL-15006](https://github.com/sparkfun/ESP32_LoRa_1Ch_Gateway)

- **Medium:** any ESP32 board with an SPI-connected RFM95W or compatible 
SX1276-based radio should work, as long as the correct pin connections are 
configured in the source (using the existing definitions as an example)

- **Advanced:** RFM69-type (SX1231H based) radios should also work, but would 
require a rewrite of all register-specific code as the register numbers and 
layouts are different.

**NOTE:** LoRa functionality is NOT REQUIRED and NOT USED. 
The choice of a LoRa capable radio was purely circumstantial, 
due to its availability and front-end capabilities. However, the LoRa modem 
is disabled at startup and never used - the radio operates in "legacy" FSK 
mode.

## Installation

### Hardware requirements
You will need a supported ESP32/RFM board (see "Easy" under "Supported hardware" above)

If purchasing new hardware for this project, we recommend the T-Beam;
its 18650 Li-Ion battery holder with on-board management and built-in 
u-blox NEO GPS will come in handy in future experiments.
Make sure to select the 915MHz "USA" version, which covers all goTenna Mesh 
bands worldwide.

### Software requirements
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) 1.8+ with [ESP32 support](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)

If setting up Arduino/ESP32 for the first time, refer to the 
[recommended installation instructions](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md).

### Dependencies
The only external dependency is the **Time** library by Michael Margolis - 
install it using the *Tools > Manage Libraries* menu option in the 
Arduino IDE.

All other required libraries are included (see **Credits** section for details)

### Build and install

- Download the code (all files) from https://github.com/sybip/gtm-lab
- Open `gtm-lab` in the Arduino IDE
- **do not skip this step** Edit the `gtmConfig.h` file and change the 
`BOARD_TYPE` and `ISM_REGION` definitions to suit your environment
- Select your ESP32 board from the Arduino *Tools > Board* menu (e.g. *T-Beam*)
- Compile and upload to your board.

All done - you're ready to play!

## Operation
### Basic operation - packet logger and simple shouter
Connect to the board's USB port with a serial terminal at 115200bps.
Using your goTenna Mesh kit, generate some goTenna message traffic (ping, 
location tethering etc).
The messages should appear in the serial terminal:
```
I (6475353) GTMLAB: RX CCh=01 SYNC(1): chIDX=1, frags=2, iniTTL=3, curTTL=2
I (6475404) GTMLAB: RX DCh=42 DATA(2): len=90, fragIDX=0
I (6475436) GTMLAB: RX DCh=41 DATA(2): len=45, fragIDX=1
I (6475436) GTMLAB: complete: len=135, hash=0xcafe, time=88ms
RX_MSG:0302|003fff55555555555500ff0000fb100100......
```

Type a short text in the serial console and press Enter. The text will be 
transmitted as a SHOUT class message, and (assuming that all your settings 
are correct) received by the goTenna Mesh clients in range.

**NOTE:** By default, gtm-lab will transmit on the **testnet** AppID 0x7357, 
therefore shouted messages will **not** be received by the goTenna app.
This is intentional to minimize unwanted interference with goTenna app traffic.
To enable sending to goTenna app, enter command `!sa3fff` in the gtm-lab
console (set AppID to 0x3fff), and messages will become visible.

### Radio protocol exploration
Change the `VERBOSITY` line to `ESP_LOG_DEBUG` or even `ESP_LOG_VERBOSE` 
to view details of received packets, correction protocols, channel hopping etc.

### Message formats exploration
The output lines prefixed with `RX_ACK` and `RX_MSG` contain full hex dumps of 
received radio traffic (see the source code for details on what some of those 
bytes mean). All message classes are received, including encrypted messages.

These objects can be further processed on the computer using a Python or PERL 
script to study the format of the packets and extract useful information.

Example: [metalogger](https://gist.github.com/sybip/4b754010cf5a667c161f3ae3d8d106ef)

### Test console
Implemented in the `playHarder.cpp` file and documented inline, and subject 
to continuous breaking changes.
